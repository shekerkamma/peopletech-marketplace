# Presentation Content Writer Skill

Generates slide content from topics, outlines, or rough notes. Focuses on **what to say**, not how to format it.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Determine what the user needs:
- **Topic only** — "create slides about X" → research and generate full content
- **Outline** — bullet points or structure → flesh out into slide content
- **Rough notes** — raw ideas → organize into a narrative arc
- **Single slide** — "add a slide about Y after slide N" → generate one slide's content

### Step 2: Research (if needed)

If the topic requires current data or specific facts:
- Use WebSearch to gather key statistics, quotes, and examples
- Use WebFetch to pull specific sources
- Cite sources in speaker notes, not on slides

### Step 3: Generate Content Structure

For each slide, produce:

```markdown
## Slide N: [Title]
**Type**: content | section-divider | comparison | code-example | list | quote

### Key Message
[One sentence — the single takeaway for this slide]

### Content
[Bullet points, comparison columns, code snippets, or narrative text]

### Speaker Notes
[What to say when presenting this slide — 2-4 sentences]

### Transition
[How this slide connects to the next one]
```

### Step 4: Apply Content Principles

Follow these presentation content rules:

1. **One idea per slide** — if you need "and" in the title, split into two slides
2. **6-word titles** — titles should be statements, not topics ("Data Governance Drives AI Success" not "Data Governance")
3. **Rule of three** — group content into 3 points, 3 examples, 3 steps
4. **Concrete over abstract** — use specific numbers, names, and examples
5. **Progressive disclosure** — each slide should build on the previous one
6. **Contrast drives clarity** — use before/after, good/bad, old/new comparisons
7. **End with action** — final slide should tell the audience what to do next

### Step 5: Determine Slide Types

Match content to the best slide pattern:

| Content Type | Slide Pattern | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| New section intro | Section divider | Starting a new topic area |
| Before/after comparison | Two-column (good/bad) | Showing transformation or contrast |
| Technical concept | Code block + explanation | Teaching syntax or configuration |
| Feature list | Icon list | Showing capabilities or options |
| Key concept | Trigger box | Highlighting important ideas |
| Warning or caveat | Warning box | Calling out risks or gotchas |
| Statistic or quote | Large centered text | Making a single point memorable |

### Step 6: Output

Deliver content in one of two formats based on the user's needs:

**Content-only** (default): Markdown document with slide content, ready for the user or `presentation-curator` to convert to HTML.

**HTML-ready**: If the user wants slides added directly, provide the HTML using the presentation's CSS classes. Delegate to the `presentation-curator` agent for actual insertion.

## Content Templates

### Opening Slide (Hook)
- Start with a surprising statistic or provocative question
- Make the audience feel the problem before offering the solution
- Example: "54% of C-suite executives say AI adoption is tearing their company apart"

### Teaching Slide (Concept)
- Title states the takeaway
- 3 bullet points max
- One concrete example or code snippet
- Speaker note explains the "why"

### Comparison Slide (Before/After)
- Left column: the problem state (red/bad styling)
- Right column: the solution state (green/good styling)
- Title frames the transformation

### Closing Slide (Call to Action)
- Summarize in 3 points
- Give one specific next step
- End with a memorable statement or callback to the opening hook
