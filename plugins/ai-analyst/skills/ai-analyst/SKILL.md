# AI Analyst — Claude Code Edition

Ask a business question in plain English. Get validated findings, publication-quality charts, and a slide deck.

Converted from the [AI Analyst Plugin](https://github.com/ai-analyst-lab/ai-analyst-plugin) for Claude Cowork.

## What You Get

- **39 skills** — question framing, metric definition, data exploration, forecasting, experiment design, and more
- **18 agents** — specialized analytical agents for hypothesis testing, cohort analysis, root cause investigation, storytelling, chart-making, and deck creation
- **Publication-quality charts** — styled visualizations with consistent theming
- **Slide decks** — Marp-powered presentations ready for stakeholder readouts
- **Data validation** — built-in confidence scoring, source tieout, and logical validation

## Quick Start

Just ask a question:
- "Which channel has the highest churn and why?"
- "Show me MRR trends over time"
- "Compare Q1 vs Q2 conversion rates"

The `ask-question` skill is the mandatory entry point. It loads workspace context, routes to the right analytical agent, and ensures quality standards.

## Pipeline

```
Question → Frame → Hypothesize → Explore → Validate Source
    → Analyze → Investigate Root Cause → Size Opportunity
    → Design Experiment → Validate Findings
    → Storyboard → Chart → Critique → Narrate → Present → Communicate
```
