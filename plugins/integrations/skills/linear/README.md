# Linear CLI

Manage issues, projects, cycles, and teams via the Linear API with offline search and analytics.

## Install

### Go

```
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/project-management/linear/cmd/linear-pp-cli@latest
```

### Binary

Download from [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/linear-current).

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-linear --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-linear --force
```

## Install for OpenClaw

Tell your OpenClaw agent (copy this):

```
Install the pp-linear skill from https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/tree/main/cli-skills/pp-linear. The skill defines how its required CLI can be installed.
```

## Authentication

Create a **personal API key** under **Settings → Account → Security & access** while logged into Linear: [Security & access](https://linear.app/settings/account/security). (The **Integrations / Connected accounts** page is for linking Slack, GitHub, etc., not for API keys.)

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_abc123..."
```

Or persist with:

```bash
linear-pp-cli auth set-api-key "lin_api_abc123..."
```

That writes `~/.config/linear-pp-cli/config.toml` (field `api_key`). For OAuth-style **access tokens** (advanced), use `linear-pp-cli auth set-token` instead. You can also edit the file directly:

```toml
api_key = "lin_api_abc123..."
```

**Cursor users:** see [CURSOR.md](./CURSOR.md) for a short setup guide (MCP vs skill, where keys live, verification).


To override the API base URL (for self-hosted or proxied setups):

```bash
export LINEAR_BASE_URL="https://your-proxy.example.com/graphql"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check that credentials are working
linear-pp-cli doctor

# Sync issues, projects, teams, cycles, labels, and users locally
linear-pp-cli sync

# See your issues for today across all teams
linear-pp-cli today

# Look up a specific issue
linear-pp-cli issues ESP-1155

# List issues assigned to you (excludes completed/canceled by default)
linear-pp-cli issues list --assignee me

# Narrow to a team and state, output JSON
linear-pp-cli issues list --team ESP --state started --json

# Find stale issues that need attention
linear-pp-cli stale --days 14

# Search for potential duplicate issues
linear-pp-cli similar "login timeout"
```

## Finding Issues

`issues <ID>` fetches a single issue. Resolution order with the default `--data-source auto`:

1. local sqlite store, matched by identifier
2. live Linear GraphQL query (POST)
3. on live failure with a stale store, return the store miss as not found

`issues list` lists issues from the local store. Run `linear-pp-cli sync` first.

Filters compose with AND:

| Flag | Accepts | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--assignee` | `me`, UUID, display name, or email | `me` resolves the authenticated viewer via a live query |
| `--state` | `active` (default), `started`, `backlog`, `unstarted`, `completed`, `canceled`, `triage`, `all` | Matches `state.type`, so custom state names still work |
| `--team` | Team key (e.g. `ESP`) or UUID | Resolved against the local `teams` table |
| `--project` | Project name or UUID | Resolved against the local `projects` table |
| `--limit` | Integer | Defaults to 200 |
| `--json` | Flag | JSON output for piping to `jq` |

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`today`** — See all your issues for today across every team, ranked by priority and cycle deadline.

  _When an agent is asked 'what should I work on right now?', this returns the ranked list in one call instead of N team-scoped list queries._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli today --json --select identifier,title,priority,cycle.endsAt
  ```
- **`bottleneck`** — See which team members are overloaded and which issues are blocked before sprint planning.

  _Pre-sprint-planning question 'who is overloaded right now' becomes a single agent call instead of scrolling N tabs._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli bottleneck --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`projects burndown`** — Project a project's landing date by linear-regressing remaining estimate against the team's measured velocity.

  _Replaces static project target-dates with a velocity-driven projection an agent can compare against the milestone date._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli projects burndown PROJ-42 --json
  ```
- **`cycles compare`** — Side-by-side metrics between any two cycles: completion %, scope added, scope cut, carryover, average cycle time.

  _Friday-update ritual: 'how does this cycle compare to last cycle?' becomes one call._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli cycles compare 42 43 --json
  ```
- **`stale`** — Find issues that haven't been touched in N days, grouped by team and project.

  _Backlog-grooming workflow: surface zombie issues without paying API complexity for a full scan._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli stale --days 30 --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`slipped`** — Show what carried over from last cycle into this cycle, grouped by team and reason heuristic.

  _Maya's Friday update needs 'what slipped' as a structured list, not a manual count._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli slipped --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`blocking`** — Show issues you are blocking — sorted by impact (downstream count and priority).

  _Daily ritual: 'what's blocked because of me' becomes one call instead of clicking through every assigned issue._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli blocking --json
  ```
- **`similar`** — Find issues that look like duplicates of a query string using offline FTS5 fuzzy matching.

  _Triage and grooming: catch dupes before filing or while sweeping the inbox._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli similar "login button broken" --json
  ```
- **`velocity`** — Track sprint completion rates over the last N cycles to spot productivity trends.

  _Multi-cycle trend lines feed the burndown projection and the weekly stakeholder update._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli velocity --weeks 8 --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`initiatives health`** — Rolled-up portfolio view per initiative: child project progress, milestone target-vs-projected dates, slippage flags.

  _Portfolio review: 'which milestone in my portfolio is most at risk this month' becomes one ranked answer._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli initiatives health --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`pp-test list`** — List Linear issues this CLI created in the current or named session, then archive them with pp-cleanup.

  _Lets agents create test issues during a session and clean up only their own fixtures, never touching pre-existing tickets._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli pp-test list --session current && linear-pp-cli pp-cleanup --session current --dry-run
  ```
- **`issues create`** — Refuse mutations on Linear issues not in the local pp_created ledger when --trust-mode strict is set; works on the create command and any future mutation surfaces.

  _When an agent runs against a real workspace, this is the safety net that prevents silent damage to non-test data._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli issues create --title "test" --team ENG --trust-mode strict --session demo
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
linear-pp-cli today

# JSON for scripting and agents
linear-pp-cli today --json

# Filter to specific fields
linear-pp-cli issues abc123 --json --select id,title,state

# CSV for spreadsheets
linear-pp-cli stale --days 30 --csv

# Dry run - show the request without sending
linear-pp-cli issues abc123 --dry-run

# Compact mode - minimal fields for token efficiency
linear-pp-cli today --compact

# Agent mode - JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
linear-pp-cli today --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - `echo '{"key":"value"}' | linear-pp-cli integrations create --stdin`
- **Cacheable** - GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** - paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr in default mode

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add linear linear-pp-mcp -e LINEAR_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "linear-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Health Check

```bash
$ linear-pp-cli doctor
Checking CLI health...

  Config file    ~/.config/linear-pp-cli/config.toml
  API key        set (env:LINEAR_API_KEY)
  Base URL       https://api.linear.app/graphql
  Connectivity   ok
  Local store    ~/.local/share/linear-pp-cli/store.db (synced)
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/linear-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | API key for authentication (required) |
| `LINEAR_BASE_URL` | Override the API base URL (default: `https://api.linear.app/graphql`) |
| `LINEAR_CONFIG` | Override the config file path |

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `linear-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $LINEAR_API_KEY`
- Get a new key at [linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api)

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Use `linear-pp-cli sql "SELECT id, title FROM issues LIMIT 5"` to browse available items

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with exponential backoff
- Use `--rate-limit 2` to cap requests per second
- If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

**Sync errors**
- Run `linear-pp-cli sync --full` for a clean re-sync
- Check connectivity with `linear-pp-cli doctor`

**Empty results from analytics commands**
- Run `linear-pp-cli sync` first to populate the local store
- Check that your API key has access to the relevant teams

## Agent workflow features

This CLI was patched to add these agent-workflow capabilities (see [`printing-press patch`](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/pull/221)):

- **Named profiles** — save a set of flags under a name and reuse them: `linear-pp-cli profile save <name> --<flag> <value>`, then `linear-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>`. Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.
- **`--deliver`** — route command output to a sink other than stdout. Values: `file:<path>` writes atomically via tmp+rename; `webhook:<url>` POSTs as JSON (or NDJSON with `--compact`).
- **`feedback`** — record in-band feedback about the CLI. Entries append as JSON lines to `~/.linear-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. When `LINEAR_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `LINEAR_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream.
