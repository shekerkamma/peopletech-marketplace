# NotebookLM Skill

Automate NotebookLM using the Chrome browser. You navigate to notebooklm.google.com, create or open a notebook, add a source, and trigger content generation.

---

## Tools required
- `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__*` — all browser automation tools

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Prepare the source file
If the content is in memory (not yet saved), write it to a `.md` or `.txt` file in the working directory first. NotebookLM accepts uploaded files.

### Step 2 — Open NotebookLM
```
navigate → https://notebooklm.google.com
```
Wait for the page to load. If the user is not signed in, stop and ask them to sign in to their Google account first — do not attempt to handle login.

### Step 3 — Create a new notebook or open existing
**New notebook:**
- Click "New notebook" button
- Give it a meaningful name related to the content

**Existing notebook:**
- Find it by name in the notebook list and click it

### Step 4 — Add the source
- Click "Add source" (or the + button in the Sources panel)
- Choose "Upload file" and select the prepared `.md` or `.txt` file
- Wait for the source to finish processing (spinner disappears)

### Step 5 — Generate content (pick one based on user request)

| User wants | Action |
|---|---|
| Overview / summary | Click "Notebook guide" → "Table of contents" or "Briefing doc" |
| Audio overview | Click "Audio overview" → "Generate" |
| FAQ / Q&A | Click "Notebook guide" → "FAQ" |
| Study guide | Click "Notebook guide" → "Study guide" |
| Just explore | Leave it — the notebook is ready for the user to query |

### Step 6 — Report back
Tell the user:
- The notebook name
- What was generated
- That they can now ask questions in the chat panel on the right

## Architecture Documentation variant

When used after generating an architecture document or draw.io diagram, do this:

1. Write a structured markdown file with:
   - Title and one-paragraph summary
   - Layer-by-layer breakdown (what each component does and why)
   - Key data flows explained in plain English
   - Design decisions and trade-offs

2. Upload that file to NotebookLM

3. Generate a **Briefing doc** — this gives a professional written overview with context

4. Tell the user they can ask questions like:
   - "Why does the Tool Executor connect to MCP servers?"
   - "What happens when a user types a command?"
   - "Explain the Permission Manager's role"

---

## Known Limitation — Chrome MCP Domain Restriction
The Chrome MCP (`mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate`) **cannot navigate to notebooklm.google.com** — it is blocked at the domain level. If navigation fails, stop and give the user these manual steps:

1. Open Chrome → go to **https://notebooklm.google.com**
2. Click **"New notebook"** → name it
3. **"Add source"** → **"Upload file"** → select the `.md` file
4. Wait for spinner to disappear
5. **"Notebook guide"** → **"Briefing doc"** (or FAQ / Study guide)

Then tell them what questions they can ask in the chat panel.

## Mistakes to avoid
- Do NOT attempt to log in or handle Google auth — stop and ask the user to sign in first
- Do NOT upload sensitive files (credentials, env files, API keys)
- Do NOT click "Generate audio" unless the user explicitly asks — it takes several minutes
- If a spinner is visible, wait — do not click again
- If the source fails to upload, try copy-pasting the text directly using "Paste text" option instead

## You're done when
- The notebook is created with at least one source added
- The requested content type (briefing, FAQ, audio, etc.) has been triggered or generated
- You've told the user the notebook name and what to do next
